PresentXR is an immersive solution where regular business users create & deliver captivating presentations. Unlike traditional presenting software, PresentXR boosts audience attention to your message instead of being distracted by their smartphones (which are now occluded from view).

## Inspiration
* Storytelling power of immersive media.
* Need for immersive content creation tools useable by business stakeholders.
* Pain at industry conference booth audiences paying more attention to their cellphone (which, in a headset, becomes impossible)
* Movies like Iron Man, Minority Report, Avatar, where spatial media has been used for user interaction surpassing what's possible on flat pieces of plastic

## What it does

1) Composition
* Scenes-as-slides
* Add & manipulate text, image, video, 3D models, sound, map, dataviz .. using Iron Man-style interface about your hand

2) Presentation
* Paging through immersive scenes-as-slides
* Sample presentation that tells the story of global warming, which the user is asked to use our tool to complete

## How we built it
* Discussing pain points
* Exploring interaction models & available resources
* Storyboarding workflows
* Decomposing work breakdown structure & assignments
* Hourly "stand up"'s

## Challenges we ran into
* Incompatible packages
* Learning new SDKs & hardware in finite time
* Collisions between static rigid bodies & kinematics (poorly documented SDK use case)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Interact in VR using hands
* Easy to use physical interaction with spatial content
* Document model for immersive "PowerPoint"

## What we learned
* Leap Motion SDK

## What's next for PresentXR?
* Import existing content e.g. PowerPoint slides, as a starting point for immersive slides one builds around (i.e. meet users where they already have content & ease the transition)
* UI toolkit for uniquely spatial computing (as a basis for this & other projects)
* Speaker training using AR (Method of Loci for memorizing your talk)

## Team Bios
* Aaron Moffatt has worked at the intersection of film, music, and technology for a decade and a half – as a bioinformatics software engineer, a VR/emerging technology startup founder, and a symphony and solo violinist.

* Lewis Gardner is a full-stack XR software engineer fluent in 15+ languages.

* Elena is a graduate research assistant at the MIT Media Lab. Her current research involves exploring the use of multi-sensory media to create new interactions that blend the digital realm with the physical.

* Aaron Briones is an Experience Designer with a formal education in Human Computer Interaction. He is passionate about creating experiences that people love using.

* Bob Levy is CEO of Immersion Analytics. He speaks regularly on XR with talks including MIT Technology Review's EmTech Caribbean, O’Reilly Media’s Strata Data Conference, DataWorld, StartupFest, QuantCon & AR in Action / MIT Media Lab.
